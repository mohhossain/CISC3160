The web app that I created implements two APIs. Openweathermap api and Speechsynthesis api. To use it, press and hold the button on the screen and speak the name of your desired city and let go of the button. The speechsysnthesis api will take the voice input and convert it to a string. Then the string will be passed to call the openweathermap api and it will return the weather for the desired location. The program also convert the temperature data from celcius to farenheit. I attached a picture of the web app with the name "demo.png".
